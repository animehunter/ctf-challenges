Original Message From Jimmy:
Yo wussup peoples. 
So I just got done with my Sockets Programming 101 class and I got an A! 
So i was like, fuck it ima go code some shit up and see how dumb other people are! 
So I wrote my first authentication server! 
This thing is slick! 
If you break it then you’re actually pretty damn good in my book! 

Just connect to jimmy.goldenflag.com with net cat and see if you can solve my little puzzle :). 
I gave you a python script and some old version of my authenticator server so you won’t be completely lost :) 
Have fun NOOBS!
